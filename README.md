Tree and Tree Algorithms Visualization

The code uses Graphviz for visualization purpose. 
(http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)

Place the codes in Bin directory in Graphviz installation (or specify the directory in the C code).

Visualization header file outputs a PNG of the current structure of the tree.

Inorder and Preorder visualization codes try to explain the recursive algorithms by showing the nodes present in the system stack using seperate color(red).
