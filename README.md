Tree and Tree Algorithms Visualization

The code uses Graphviz for visualization purpose. 
(http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)

Place the codes in Bin directory in Graphviz installation (or specify the directory in the C code).

Inorder and Preorder visualization tries to explain the recursive algorithms by showing the nodes present in the system stack using seperate color(red).
